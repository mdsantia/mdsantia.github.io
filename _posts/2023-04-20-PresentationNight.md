During the Spring 2023 semester, I had the opportunity to share with the Department of Mathematics at Purdue University some of the ideas I worked on during the previous Summer 2022 with [Dr. Thomas Sinclair](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~tsincla/) and other peers in the field, [Colton Griffin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colton-griffin-9b1b3b191/), [Sanchita Chakraborty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanchita-chakraborty-8107a9192/), and Yuxiao Wang. I will try to summarize the presentation, as well as our preleminary results from when we worked on the project.
