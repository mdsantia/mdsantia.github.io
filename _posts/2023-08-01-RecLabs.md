After four semesters teaching different applications of Differential Equations concepts at Purdue's Recitation section through computational laboratories, I want to share some hints and advice to aid your understanding of the concepts and interactions with the software in each lab. You could also find additional information about the labs as well as the problems in the [Project Rhea Website](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/index.php/MA366_Lab).

In terms of grading, just make sure to check the rubrics as shown in the Rhea website's lab table to have all the required information in your submitted file to be graded. Also ensure that all your problems and graphs are labeled. I recommend having your labs in a typeset document (Word or Google Docs) with all the necessary details (screenshots, pictures, and equations) for each problem to convert as a PDF.

# Lab 0 – Introduction
[Access to Lab 0](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/images/a/ae/Lab00_MA366lab.pdf)

## Logistics
All the software can be downloaded unto your personal computers, although they are also available on the classroom desktops. Dfield and Pplane can be downloaded on [this site](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~joel/dfield/?_ga=2.40824994.1858414481.1660563097–1244178105.1658237797). There is also an online alternative that incorporates both Dfield and Pplane (one and system of two ODEs) features by [Bluffton University](https://homepages.bluffton.edu/~nesterd/apps/slopefields.html). Matlab and Maple can be accessed remotely through the [go remote site](http://goremote.itap.purdue.edu/) with your Purdue Credentials, or can be downloaded through [Matlab](https://login.mathworks.com/embedded–login/landing.html?cid=mktg&wid=cwl) and [Maple](https://www.Maplesoft.com/products/Maple/free–trial/).

**DO NOT FORGET** to please fill out the Lab 0 form. Although the lab is not to be submitted, the form is. Read the syllabus at your own time and get familiar with the different platforms the class will be utilizing, i.e., [Brightspace](https://purdue.brightspace.com/d2l/login), the [Project Rhea Page](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/index.php/MA366_Lab), and the different softwares (DField, PPlane, Matlab, and Maple).

## Advice
The main goal of this lab is to help you get familiar with the tools we will be working on throughout the semester. Do not worry if you do not feel comfortable during your first go at the different softwares as we will emphasize the important details next lab. The main takeaways are:
1. how to plot in DField, PPlane, and Matlab (with fplot)
2. the __Keyboard Input__ to plot a specific solution onto PPlane and DField
3. zooming in and out on these sofwares
4. the inference process to find the different solutions.

The underlying code to follow along in __Problem 5__ is as follows:
```Matlab
>>  grid on
    hold on
    xlim([–10,10])
    ylim([–10,10])
    fplot('x*exp(–2*x)+x^3+cos(pi * x) + 1', 'g');
```

# Lab 1 – CSI for an Hour
[Access to Lab 1](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/images/9/98/Lab01_MA366lab.pdf)

## Overview
The analysis of thermodynamical systems using differential equations is a fundamental approach in physics and engineering. Think of thermal equilibrium in the same way radiative decay was studied in high school, the more time elapses, the slower an object cools down. This occurs because the closer in tempreature two bodies are, the slower they exchange heat to reach equilibrium. In other words, the rate of temperature of two bodies varies on their temperature difference. The smaller this difference is, the slower the temperature change rate is. 

For our analysis, let us set the bodies to be a room and an object in a room, where the temperature we are interested is of the latter, denoted as `T`. Fix the object's temperature to be colder than the room's temperature `R`. From our past discussion, becuase the rate of change is proportional to the difference, let `k` represent the constant that relates the difference to the rate (we wish for it to be positive). Thus, we can express this behaviour as,

<div align="center">
    <img src=https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dT}{dt}=-k(T-R). alt="rate of temperature change dT/dt">
</div>

## Problem Statemet
How can we relate the discussion above to a corpse laying in a room with no clear idea of how long it was last alive? Well, we can let the object in our analysis to be the corpse while we replace `R` with the value of our circumstance. Firstly, we need to approximate the value of `k`, which can be easily done with two measurements, then we can relate the equation to our initial input values from our mesaurements. For the picture to become clearer, try it yourself doing the problems in the lab which go into more detail. 

## Main Takewaways
1. Ensure that the variable naming is consistent with the notation we have in our labs to avoid confusion. Having the proper independent and dependent variables while ensuring the parameter names are different from the variables.
2. There are multiple ways to enter constant parameter values in Dfield. Throughout the semester, I will enter the parameter values in the __Parameter Expressions__ section where it is easier to alter constant values.
3. Remember to alter the display window range according to the analysis. In this case, our analysis ranges for `T` at most 100° but no lower than 70°, meanwhile `t` is between -5 and 5 as time is offset ±5 hours from midnight.

## Common Confusion
__Problem 8__ is usually confusing at first, think about it in terms of the following timeline.

<div align="center">
    <img src=/images/Lab%201.8%20Diagram.jpeg alt="Timeline of the problem">
</div>

So far, we have been treating midnight to be
![t=0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t=0)
where we made our first measurement of the temperature. However, now at time 
![t=-1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t=-1,)
11pm, there is a discontinuity in the temperature of the room. So we need to relate 
![T'_1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dT_1}{dt}=-k(T-70))
and
![T'_2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dT_2}{dt}=-k(T-(65+\frac{seed}{60})))
in terms of their respective initial values for our problem. 

First, we need to backtrace the temperature of the body at the moment of the temperature change. This value would become the `T` initial value of ![T'_2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dT_2}{dt}). It is simpler to keep `t` as the value from our initial continuity, i.e., -1. From this new resulting curve, we can approximate when the body was last alive with a 98.6°F body temperature, as done in previous problems. Remember to add from midnight this `t` value to see the approximate hour of the day the body was last alive.

# Lab 2 – Understanding Escape Velocity
[Access to Lab 2](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/images/4/4c/Lab02.desc.pdf)

## Logistics
This is the first lab that has presentation assignments. I will use this as a reminder that presentation notes are due Monday night before your presentation assignment. For example, if you are assigned __Problem 5a__ from lab 2, and we are discussing this lab next Tuesday, email and submit through Brightspace your notes by next Monday so I can comment and correct if necessary. Refer to [Brightspace](https://purdue.brightspace.com/d2l/login) if you are wondering what problem you have been assigned for your presentation. All the dates corresponding to them are described in the same table as well.

## Overview
Gravitational problems are a common place to understand differential equations relating position, velocity, and acceleration together through simple derivatives. This simple, yet insightful, type of problem can show how systems of equations builds a bigger picture that could be easily overlooked when expressing equations in one. Problems 1 and 2 show this principle visually through Dfield and Pplane. Dfield is limited to one differential equation, while Pplane can work with systems of differential equations with two dependent variables. 

## Advice
For __Problem 3__, please build a table with the underlying information. The template would be something like

<!-- | v(0) || Height (y) || Height (x, i.e., miles) || Velocity (v) || Velocity (mi/sec) |
| 0.5 || (value/N) || (value/N) 				|| (value/N) || (value/N) |
| 1.0 || (value/N) || (value/N) 				|| (value/N) || (value/N) |
| 1.5 || (value/N) || (value/N) 				|| (value/N) || (value/N) |
| 2.0 || (value/N) || (value/N) 				|| (value/N) || (value/N) | -->

<table>
  <tr>
	<th>v(0)</th>
	<th>Height (y)</th>
	<th>Height (x, i.e., miles)</th>
	<th>Velocity (v)</th>
	<th>Velocity (mi/s)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>0.5</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>1.0</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>1.5</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>2.0</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
	<td>(value/N)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

where (value/N) stands in for either __N__ when it does not apply or __value__ for the approximate value from the graph in the appropriate units. The does not apply stands for when there is no maximum height (it leaves Earth) or if there is no velocity at escape (it fell back to Earth).

For __Problem 5__, recall basic Algebra, Calculus, and the course for evauluation through substitution, limits, and first order differential equation solution of seperable variables. 

Problems 6 and 7 are the most time consuming problem in the lab. Trying to patch our understanding of escape velocity with air resitance as an additional force in the system. Algebraically, the air resistance only affects the second order derivative through Newton's Second Law of Motion. Based on this, we can find the position equation in terms of `y` through integration and initial values to find the constant of integration. Their template MATLAB code (replacing their appropriate `fplot` equation) is:

```Matlab
>>  grid on
    hold on
    fplot('100*x-10^4*log(1+0.01*x)-1')
```

## Common Confusion
Our variables for position are x and y while time is in terms of t and s. Treat x and t as your real units (mile and second respectively) variables while y and s are imaginary unit variables used to simplify calculations. Thus, we have to constantly convert our results to tangible units (x and t). The basic conversions are given by

<div align="center">
    <img src=https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x=4000y, alt="x=">
</div>

<div align="center">
    <img src=https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?s=\sqrt{\frac{0.0061}{4000}}t. alt="s=">
</div>

The confusion arises when differentiating, which by chain rule differentiation we have,

<div align="center">
    <img src=https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dx}{dt}=4000v\frac{ds}{dt}., alt="dx/dt=">
</div>

Recall that `v` is our independent variable which is given by
![v=dy/ds](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?v=\frac{dy}{ds})
and that 
![dx/dy](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dx}{dy}=4000)
and
![ds/dt](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{ds}{dt}=\sqrt{\frac{0.0061}{4000}})
are constants calculated from the equations above. Therefore, to build the table in __Problem 3__, we only need the equation for 
![dx/dt](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dx}{dt})
, the evaluation of constants, and `v` value.

# Lab 3 – Existence and Uniqueness Theorems
[Access to Lab 3](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/images/5/56/Lab03.desc-2.pdf)

## Introduction
It is incredibly crucial to understand the two theorems foundational for our discussion:

### Existence Theorem
If 
![f(t, x)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f(t,x))
is defined and continuous on a rectangle
![R](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?R)
in the tx-plane, then given any point 
![(t_0, x_0) ∈ R](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(t_0,x_0)\in&space;R,)
<!-- (t_0, x_0) ∈ R, -->
the initial value problem

<div align="center">
	<!-- x' = f(t, x) and x(t_0) = x_0  -->
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\begin{cases}x'=f(t,x)\\x(t_0)=x_0\end{cases}," alt="{x'=f(t,x) and x(t_0)=x_0">
</div>

has a solution
![x(t)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x(t))
defined in an interval containing
![t_0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t_0.)

### Uniqueness Theorem
If 
![f(t, x)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f(t,x)) and 
![f(t, x)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f(t,x))
are both continuous on a rectangle
![R](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?R)
in the tx-plane, 
![(t_0, x_0) ∈ R](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(t_0,x_0)\in&space;R,)
and if both 
![x(t)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x(t))
and
![y(t)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y(t))
satisfy the same initial problem 
![x'=f(t,x)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x'=f(t,x))
and
![x(t_0)=x_0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x(t_0)=x_0,)
then as long as 
![(t,x(t))](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(t,x(t)))
and
![(t,y(t))](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(t,y(t)))
stay in 
![R](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?R)
, we have 
![x(t)=y(t)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x(t)=y(t).)

## Useful Test
One powerful test to wrap our minds around such a abstract concept is as follows:

Let 
![x'=f(t,x)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x'=f(t,x))
and
![x(t_0)=x_0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x(t_0)=x_0,)
then ask, 
1. Can we choose an open rectangle that contains  
![(t_0, x_0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(t_0,x_0),)
such that
![f](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f)
is continuous?
2. Can we choose an open rectangle that contains  
![(t_0, x_0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(t_0,x_0),)
such that
![f_x](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f_x)
is continuous?


If question one is true, then Existence Theorem applies. If both are true, then Uniqueness Theorem applies.

## Analytical Examples
### Existence does not hold
1. ![x'=\frac{1}{t}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x'=\frac{1}{t})
and any 
![t_0=0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t_0=0).

2. Similarly,
![x'=\frac{1}{x}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x'=\frac{1}{x})
and any 
![x_0=0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_0=0.)
Although, this case is much more interesting because plotwise, it seems like there exists a solution by choosing either of two functions such that its corresponding unilateral limit is zero, i.e,
![\lim_{t\to t_0^{\pm}}x(t)=0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\lim_{t\to&space;t_0^{\pm}}x(t)=0.)

### Uniqueness does not hold
1. ![x'=\frac{1}{t}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x'=\frac{1}{t})
and any 
![t_0=0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t_0=0).

2. ![x'=\sqrt(x)=x^(1/2)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x'=\sqrt{x}=x^{\frac{1}{2}})
and any 
![x_0=0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_0=0).

## Biggest Takeaways
### Converse – Problem 2

Note that their is an intentional word choice to describe the theorems and whether or not it *holds*. This is because the converse of each theorem is not necessarily true (I am not sure if the converse of Uniqueness is, as I could not find or think of a counterexample but Existence Theorem's converse does not hold). An easy example is covered in __Problem 2__ with
![x'=A\frac{x}{t}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x'=A\frac{x}{t})
where Existence Theorem does not hold (and by consequence Uniqueness does not either) for any *t=0*.
When solving through the Separable Method, we find
![x(t)=Ct^A](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x(t)=Ct^A)
for the constant of integration based on the initial value. Therefore, if we define the initial value to be given by 
![x(0)=0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x(0)=0)
we can see that there exists infinitely many *C* values that satisfy the system.

### Uniqueness Neighborhood – Problems 3 & 4

It is quite easy to overlook the fact that the Existence Theorem does not give insight to how the existing function might behave like. In other words, the only properties we know of the solution functions are given by the initial conditions we start off with, and we will not be able to get any additional properties outside of the neighborhood (rectangle *R*) without considering other initial values. Which is why __Problem 3__ might seem counterintuitive at first as we are told a solution exists but when we evaluate the function at a different point 
![t_1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t_1)
then
![x(t_1)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x(t_1))
might not exist. Furthermore, evaluation of the function at any point outside of the initial value's neighborhood is indifferent from the previous analysis. For example, as done in __Problem 4__, we could define the parts of the solution function somewhat arbitrarily (like our age) if we are careful with the section changed to avoid violating any of the theorems by keeping *x'=f(t,x)* intact. For a helpful formulation [BYJU's](https://byjus.com/maths/existence-and-uniqueness-theorems-for-initial-value-problems/) explanation on the Uniqueness Theorem is quite helpful. The most important fact is that the Uniqueness Theorem ensures the uniqueness of the solution if the interval (rectangle) is not so large.

### Geometric Implications – Problem 5

After showing that the functions are solutions to the differential equation, let us analize what we know. The function *f(t,x)* that follows, 
![x'(t)=f(t,x)\frac{-2txe^(-x)(x-4)(x-1)}{x-3}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x'(t)=\frac{-2txe^(-x)(x-4)(x-1)}{x-3})
holds Existence and Uniqueness Theorems at all points except
![x_0=3](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_0=3.)
Notice, the problem is referring to the unaltered satisfying function called *x(t)*, in any rectangle of its domain. Thus, given that it is trivially shown the constant functions *y(t)=0,2,4* regardless of *t* are solutions, by Uniqueness Theorem, we can argue that *x(t)* cannot cross or intercept *y(t)=0,2* as the initial value is in that interval. Therefore, we can conclude the bounds are 0 and 2.

# Lab 4 – Linear First Order Differential Equations
[Access to Lab 4](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/images/0/05/Lab04.desc.pdf)

## Introduction
This lab is very unusual to all others throughout the semester. We will be utilizing Maple, which is an incredibly powerful tool to process algebraic analysis without the need of manual arithmetic manipulation. 
[Maple Help](https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/Maple/view.aspx?path=index/function&cid=513)
is an incredible resource for the standard functions and syntax of the language. Its applications are incredibly diverse, and the website contains an in depth description of applications in a variety of fields, including a manual section for Differential Equations. The main things to understand of this lab is the syntax and main functions is also shown in the discussion section of the handout which I can summarize, as below.

## Main Syntax and Functions
1. To generate a variable, we can just name it as you wish, and utilize the 
`
:=
`
to denote it from its evaluation. For example,
``` Maple
example := (expression)
```
2. To denote a differential, i.e, 
![\frac{d}{dt}f](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{d}{dt}f(t),)
the function 
`
diff(f(t),t)
`
is employed. While integration is done with the
`
int(f(t),t)
`
function, which disregards the integration constant.

3. With these two main points we can then build differential function variables, like
``` Maple
equation := diff(exp(2*x),x) + x^2*y
```
where 
`
exp(x)
`
represents the exponential 
![e^x](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?e^x)
function.

4. To solve a differential equation by an initial condition, we utilize 
``` Maple
dsolve({equation, y(x_0)=y_0}, y(x)) 
# x_0 and y_0 are the given initial conditions
```

Other useful solving functions:
1. Left and right hand side `lhs()` `rhs()`, respectively, to help extract information from an expression.
2. `simplify` which applies simplification rules to an expression. 
3. `subs()` is used to substitute expressions for others.

Note, we have to specify the structure of the function by its dependent and independent variables in all of the functions. To ensure all command lines are executed properly, **I would recommend entering them one at a time**. For example, if the complete code segment is pasted, and hit enter once, I have encountered it would not simplify expressions correctly. For evaluation puposes, it is also best to ensure every line is printing the expected result.

## Code
### Problem 1
First, let us define our differential equations to work with as shown in the handout. To find the solutions given their initial input, we then utilize `dsolve()`. This should print the resulting function.
```Maple
#1
equ1 := (x^2 + 1)*diff(y(x), x) + 3*x*y(x) = 6*x;

dsolve({equ1, y(0) = -1}, y(x));

equ2 := diff(y(t), t) = (-2*t*(1 + y(t)^2))*1/y(t);

dsolve({equ2, y(0) = 1}, y(t));
```

## Problem 2
For the first part of the problem, we will need to define the **(\*\*)** differential equation. Then, we can build functions that solve the differential equation for different initial values, which we will call *f* and *g*. For this, we would need to find the initial value solution with `dsolve()`, and extract the solution with `rhs()` to define our functions with the proper `:=` syntax.
```Maple
#2a
equ := diff(y(x), x) + x^3*y(x) = x^3;

f(x) := rhs(dsolve({equ, y(0) = 2}, y(x)));

g(x) := rhs(dsolve({equ, y(0) = seed}, y(x)));
```
To print the results, just type the name of the function, for example, 
```Maple
f(x)
```
and it outputs the explicit value of the solution to the system. Please make sure *f* and *g* are printed for your submission.

For **2b** we are interested in substituting our functions back into the equation to verify they are solutions. Given the variable *equ* has two sides, we can substitute it on the left hand side expression, then simplify to verify both sides of the equality hold.

```Maple
#2b
subs(y(x) = f(x), lhs(equ));

simplify(%)

subs(y(x) = g(x), lhs(equ));

simplify(%)
```

I would argue the next subproblems are the main takeaway of the lab. Recall linearity of differentiation, meaning the derivative of a sum of functions is equivalent to the sum of their derivatives, nice properties emerge to build a possible subset of solutions to first-order differential equations. One such case is the difference and sum of solution functions to a homogeneous first-order equation.

Let us prove the difference of functions hold a solution, as we can repeat the same process from before to a generically solved defined functions, *f* and *g*, to build the difference. Thus, we can run the following:

```Maple
#2c
h(x) := f(x) - g(x);

subs(y(x)=h(x), lhs(equ))

simplify(%)
```

Hopefully it is evident why more generally for the same where, if there are two distinct functions whose differential expression simplify to the same function, their difference also solves the homogeneous differential equation of the expression. The previous claim implies the difference of two functions which solve a non-homogeneous first-order differential equation at different initial values would also solve the homogenous differential expression.  

To prove this sub-claim, as requested by the problem, we would do similarly as the previous proof, generalize to any non-homogeneous equation with *equd* and find different initial values, then expresses as follows to find it simplifies to zero as well, 

```Maple
#2d
equd := diff(y(x), x) + p(x)*y(x) = q(x);

f(x) := rhs(dsolve({equd, y(0) = a}, y(x)));

g(x) := rhs(dsolve({equd, y(0) = b}, y(x)));

h(x) := f(x) - g(x);

subs(y(x) = h(x), lhs(equd));

simplify(%)
```

Another nice property is that the sum of a solution to a first-order homogeneous differential equation and a function that satisfies the non-homegeous expression case, also solves the non-homogeneous first-order differential equation. Let us define as before with *g* and *yc*, this should simplify to the value of *q(x)*, in this case,
![x^3](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x^3)

```Maple
#2e
g(x) := rhs(dsolve({equ, y(0) = b}, y(x)));

equh := diff(y(x), x) + x^3*y(x) = 0;

yc(x) := dsolve(equh, y(x));

F(x) := yc(x) + g(x)

subs(y(x) = F(x), lhs(equ));

simplify(%)
```

We can then wrap **Problem 2** up by showing they express the same solution set as all solutions are a coefficient of *exp(l(x))* away for the smae *l(x)*. We can verify with,

```Maple
#2f
dsolve(equ, y(x))
```

## Existence and Uniqueness, again

Last week we discussed the Uniqueness and Existence Theorems, and this lab tries to make sure we understand the real implications of these theorems. First we can emphasize how the properties of the solution functions, for example where it ceases to exist (its domain), vary from initial conditions. However, we also generalize the theorems to any first-order differential equation:

If 
![p(x)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?p(x)) and 
![q(x)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?q(x))
are both continuous on the interval

which contains,

then the initial value problem 

<div align="center">
	<!-- {y' + p(x)y = q(x) and y(x_0)=y_0  -->
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\begin{cases}y'+p(x)y=q(x)\\y(x_0)=y_0\end{cases}," alt="{y' + p(x)y = q(x) and y(x_0)=y_0">
</div>

has a unique solution
![y(x)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y(x))
which exists for 
![α<x<β](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\alpha<x<\beta)
and any value of
![y_0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y_0.)

Note, we can express this equation to satisfy the Uniqueness and Existence criteria discussed before. Hopefully, once converted, it is self-evident the explanation for its behavior. We then can wrap up with an example showing how satisfying the previous theorem is sufficient to show existence and uniqueness, but not necessary, as I also clarified last lab. Just because *p* and *q* become unbounded, does not imply that the solution function also is unbounded in the same region.
