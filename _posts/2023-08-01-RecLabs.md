As I start teaching my third semester of different applications of Differential Equations concepts at Purdue's Recitation section through computational laboratories, I want to share some hints and advice to aid your understanding of the concepts and interactions with the software in each lab. You could also find additional information about the labs as well as the problems in the [Project Rhea Website](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/index.php/MA366_Lab).

In terms of grading, just make sure to check the rubrics as shown in the Rhea website's lab table to have all the required information in your submitted file to be graded. Also ensure that all your problems and graphs are labeled. I recommend having your labs in a typeset document (Word or Google Docs) with all the necessary details (screenshots, pictures, and equations) for each problem to convert as a PDF.

# Lab 0 – Introduction
[Access to Lab 0](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/images/a/ae/Lab00_MA366lab.pdf)

## Logistics
All the software can be downloaded unto your personal computers, although they are also available on the classroom desktops. Dfield and Pplane can be downloaded on [this site](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~joel/dfield/?_ga=2.40824994.1858414481.1660563097–1244178105.1658237797). There is also an online alternative that incorporates both Dfield and Pplane (one and system of two ODEs) features by [Bluffton University](https://homepages.bluffton.edu/~nesterd/apps/slopefields.html). Matlab and Maple can be accessed remotely through the [go remote site](http://goremote.itap.purdue.edu/) with your Purdue Credentials, or can be downloaded through [Matlab](https://login.mathworks.com/embedded–login/landing.html?cid=mktg&wid=cwl) and [Maple](https://www.Maplesoft.com/products/Maple/free–trial/).

**DO NOT FORGET** to please fill out the Lab 0 form. Although the lab is not to be submitted, the form is. Read the syllabus at your own time and get familiar with the different platforms the class will be utilizing, i.e., [Brightspace](https://purdue.brightspace.com/d2l/login), the [Project Rhea Page](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/index.php/MA366_Lab), and the different softwares (DField, PPlane, Matlab, and Maple).

## Advice
The main goal of this lab is to help you get familiar with the tools we will be working on throughout the semester. Do not worry if you do not feel comfortable during your first go at the different softwares as we will emphasize the important details next lab. The main takeaways are:
1. how to plot in DField, PPlane, and Matlab (with fplot)
2. the __Keyboard Input__ to plot a specific solution onto PPlane and DField
3. zooming in and out on these sofwares
4. the inference process to find the different solutions.

The underlying code to follow along in Problem 5 is as follows:
```Matlab
>>  grid on
    hold on
    xlim([–10,10])
    ylim([–10,10])
    fplot('x*exp(–2*x)+x^3+cos(pi * x) + 1', 'g');
```

# Lab 1 – CSI for an Hour

## Overview
The analysis of thermodynamical systems using differential equations is a fundamental approach in physics and engineering. Think of thermal equilibrium in the same way radiative decay was studied in high school, the more time elapses, the slower an object cools down. This occurs because the closer in tempreature two bodies are, the slower they exchange heat to reach equilibrium. In other words, the rate of temperature of two bodies varies on their temperature difference. The smaller this difference is, the slower the temperature change rate is. 

For our analysis, let us set the bodies to be a room and an object in a room, where the temperature we are interested is of the latter, denoted as `T`. Fix the object's temperature to be colder than the room's temperature `R`. From our past discussion, becuase the rate of change is proportional to the difference, let `k` represent the constant that relates the difference to the rate (we wish for it to be positive). Thus, we can express this behaviour as,

<div align="center">
    <img src=https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dT}{dt}=-k(T-R). alt="rate of temperature change dT/dt">
</div>

## Problem Statemet
How can we relate the discussion above to a corpse laying in a room with no clear idea of how long it was last alive? Well, we can let the object in our analysis to be the corpse while we replace `R` with the value of our circumstance. Firstly, we need to approximate the value of `k`, which can be easily done with two measurements, then we can relate the equation to our initial input values from our mesaurements. For the picture to become clearer, try it yourself doing the problems in the lab which go into more detail. 

## Main Takewaways
1. Ensure that the variable naming is consistent with the notation we have in our labs to avoid confusion. Having the proper independent and dependent variables while ensuring the parameter names are different from the variables.
2. There are multiple ways to enter constant parameter values in Dfield. Throughout the semester, I will enter the parameter values in the __Parameter Expressions__ section where it is easier to alter constant values.
3. Remember to alter the display window range according to the analysis. In this case, our analysis ranges for `T` at most 100° but no lower than 70°, meanwhile `t` is between -5 and 5 as time is offset ±5 hours from midnight.

## Common Confusion
Problem 8 is usually confusing at first, think about it in terms of the following timeline.

<div align="center">
    <img src=/images/Lab%201.8%20Diagram.jpeg alt="Timeline of the problem">
</div>

So far, we have been treating midnight to be
![t=0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t=0)
where we made our first measurement of the temperature. However, now at time 
![t=-1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t=-1,)
11pm, there is a discontinuity in the temperature of the room. So we need to relate 
![T'_1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dT_1}{dt}=-k(T-70))
and
![T'_2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dT_2}{dt}=-k(T-(65+\frac{seed}{60})))
in terms of their respective initial values for our problem. 

First, we need to backtrace the temperature of the body at the moment of the temperature change. This value would become the `T` initial value of ![T'_2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dT_2}{dt}). It is simpler to keep `t` as the value from our initial continuity, i.e., -1. From this new resulting curve, we can approximate when the body was last alive with a 98.6°F body temperature, as done in previous problems. Remember to add from midnight this `t` value to see the approximate hour of the day the body was last alive.

## Logistics
This is the first lab that has presentation assignments. I will use this as a reminder that presentation notes are due Monday night before your presentation assignment. For example, if you are assigned problem 5a from lab 2, and we are discussing this lab next Tuesday, email and submit through Brightspace your notes by next Monday so I can comment and correct if necessary. Refer to [Brightspace](https://purdue.brightspace.com/d2l/login) if you are wondering what problem you have been assigned for your presentation. All the dates corresponding to them are described in the same table as well.

## Overview
Gravitational problems are a common place to understand differential equations relating position, velocity, and acceleration together through simple derivatives. This simple, yet insightful, type of problem can show how systems of equations builds a bigger picture that could be easily overlooked when expressing equations in one. Problems 1 and 2 show this principle visually through Dfield and Pplane. Dfield is limited to one differential equation, while Pplane can work with systems of differential equations with two dependent variables. 

## Advice
For Problem 3, please build a table with the underlying information. The template would be something like

| v(0) | Height (y) | Height (x, i.e., miles) | Velocity (v) | Velocity (mi/sec) |
| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| 0.5 | (value/N) | (value/N) | (value/N) | (value/N) |
| 1.0 | (value/N) | (value/N) | (value/N) | (value/N) |
| 1.5 | (value/N) | (value/N) | (value/N) | (value/N) |
| 2.0 | (value/N) | (value/N) | (value/N) | (value/N) |

where (value/N) stands in for either __N__ when it does not apply or __value__ for the approximate value from the graph in the appropriate units. The does not apply stands for when there is no maximum height (it leaves Earth) or if there is no velocity at escape (it fell back to Earth).

For Problem 5, recall basic Algebra, Calculus, and the course for evauluation through substitution, limits, and first order differential equation solution of seperable variables. 

Problems 6 and 7 are the most time consuming problem in the lab. Trying to patch our understanding of escape velocity with air resitance as an additional force in the system. Algebraically, the air resistance only affects the second order derivative through Newton's Second Law of Motion. Based on this, we can find the position equation in terms of `y` through integration and initial values to find the constant of integration. Their template MATLAB code (replacing their appropriate `fplot` equation) is:

```Matlab
>>  grid on
    hold on
    fplot('100*x-10^4*log(1+0.01*x)-1')
```

## Common Confusion
Our variables for position are x and y while time is in terms of t and s. Treat x and t as your real units (mile and second respectively) variables while y and s are imaginary unit variables used to simplify calculations. Thus, we have to constantly convert our results to tangible units (x and t). The basic conversions are given by

<div align="center">
    <img src=https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x=4000y, alt="x=">
</div>

<div align="center">
    <img src=https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?s=\sqrt{\frac{0.0061}{4000}}t. alt="s=">
</div>

The confusion arises when differentiating, which by chain rule differentiation we have,

<div align="center">
    <img src=https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dx}{dt}=4000v\frac{ds}{dt}., alt="dx/dt=">
</div>

Recall that `v` is our independent variable which is given by
![v=dy/ds](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?v=\frac{dy}{ds})
and that 
![dx/dy](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dx}{dy}=4000)
and
![ds/dt](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{ds}{dt}=\sqrt{\frac{0.0061}{4000}})
are constants calculated from the equations above. Therefore, to build the table in Problem 3, we only need the equation for 
![dx/dt](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{dx}{dt})
and the evaluation of constants and `v`.
