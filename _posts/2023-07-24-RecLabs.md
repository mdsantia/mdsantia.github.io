As I start teaching my third semester of different applications of Differential Equations concepts at Purdue's Recitation section through computational laboratories, I want to share some hints and advice to aid your understanding of the concepts and interactions with the software in each lab. You could also find additional information about the labs as well as the problems in the [Project Rhea Website](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/index.php/MA366_Lab).

# Lab 0 Introduction
[Access to Lab 0](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/images/a/ae/Lab00_MA366lab.pdf)
The main goal of this lab is to help you get familiar with the tools we will be working on throughout the semester. Do not worry if you do not feel comfortable during your first go at the different softwares as we will emphasize the important details next lab. The main takeaways are:
1. how to plot in dfield, pplane, and MATLAB (with fplot)
2. the __Keyboard Input__ to plot a specific solution unto pplane and dfield
3. zooming in and out on these sofwares
4. the inference process to find the different solutions.

The underlying code to follow along in Problem 5 is as follows:
```matlab
>>  grid on
    hold on
    xlim([-10,10])
    ylim([-10,10])
    fplot('x*exp(-2*x)+x^3+cos(pi * x) + 1', 'g');
```

**DO NOT FORGET** to please fill out the Lab 0 form. Although the lab is not to be submitted, the form is. Read the syllabus at your own time and get familiar with the different platforms the class will be utilizing, i.e., [Brightspace](https://purdue.brightspace.com/d2l/login), the [Project Rhea Page](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/index.php/MA366_Lab), and the different softwares (Dfield, Pplane, MATLAB, and MAPLE).
