As I start teaching my third semester of different applications of Differential Equations concepts at Purdue's Recitation section through computational laboratories. Sharing hints and advice when understanding a concept or interacting with the software required for completion of the lab. You could also find additional information about the labs as well as the problems in the [Project Rhea Website](https://www.projectrhea.org/rhea/index.php/MA366_Lab).
