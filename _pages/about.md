I am a Mathematics and Computer Science alumni from [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/). My concentrations were in Software Engineer and Programming Languages for my Computer Science degree, while I focused on Analytical concepts in Mathematics. 

Currently I am an Applied Mathematics PhD student in the Mathematics Graduate Department at Iowa State University after one year in their Post-Baccaulareate Program. Most of my current research interests are in applied mathematics, specifically in computer science and optimization problems. I have also entretained myself with 

My biggest hobbies are all sorts of cue-sports (8-Ball and 9-ball mainly), video games (especially single player RPG franchises), recreational sports, coding, and casual philosophical discussions.
