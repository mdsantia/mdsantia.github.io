I am a Mathematics and Computer Science alumni from [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/). My concentrations were in Software Engineer and Programming Languages for my Computer Science degree, while I focused on Analytical concepts in Mathematics. 

Currently I am a Post-Baccaulareate in the Mathematics Graduate Department at Iowa State University. Although most of my research has been in pure mathematics, I have gained some interest in applied mathematics, specifically in computer science projects recently. I am applying to graduate programs to aspire for a doctoral degree. 

My biggest hobbies are all sorts of cue-sports (8-Ball and 9-ball mainly), Video Games (especially single player RPG franchises), recreational sports, coding, and casual philosophical discussions.
