I am a Mathematics and Computer Science Undergraduate at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/) where I am a candidate to graduate this upcoming May. I have concentrations in Software Engineer and Programming Languages for my Computer Science degree, while I have focused on Analysis concepts in Mathematics. There I have studied for the past 3 years, working on several personal projects and formal research. On most of my research, I have focused on pure mathematics, however, I have mostly worked in applied mathematics and computer science projects recently.

I envision myself as a Pure Mathematician researching in Analysis or Logic branches with some focus in Applied Mathematics and Industry where I would apply my computer knowledge.
