I am a Principal Engineer at [Infinia ML](https://infiniaml.com/). There I work at the intersection of
DevOps, Web Development, and Machine Learning. On a given day I may be working on a FastAPI/Django backend
while dealing with mountains of YAML for k8s deployments, writing terraform for infrastructure deployment, helping 
ML Engineers use cloud resources effectively, and helping architect awesome deployment pipelines for continuous Delivery.

I love to code. I love learning new languages/platforms/paradigms. Most of my career I have been a Python programmer
but I am always on the hunt for new exciting things in the programming/cloud space.
