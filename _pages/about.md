I am a Mathematics and Computer Science Undergraduate at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/) where I am a candidate to graduate this upcoming May. I have concentrations in Software Engineer and Programming Languages. There I studied for the past 3 years, working on several personal projects and formal research. On most of my research, I have focused on pure mathematics, however, I mostly worked on some applied mathematics and computer science projects recently.

I love to code. I love learning new mathematics. I envision myself as a Pure Mathematician researching in Analysis branches, and some focus in Applied Mathematics and Industry applying my computer knowledge.
