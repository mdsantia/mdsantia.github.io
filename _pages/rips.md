During the last few weeks of the Summer, I have been given the opportunity to work with some incredible minds in a research project with a Californian startup company that focuses on an alternate formulation of artificial intelligence. 

Our efforts during the program has been mainly focused in understanding the motivation and implementation of their novel concept of intelligence in computers without intense and long training processes. This has encompassed understanding some:
1. Reinforcement Learning
2. Kalman Filter
3. Particle Methods
4. Control Theory.

Most of our work has been implementing an algorithm to different problems and gauging its practicality.

For a generic motivation and explanation of our work, [this link](https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/9235809) will contain the main reference for our project.
