As is seemingly more common in our field of Astrophysics, I am working on making the
transition to Data Science. As part of the learning process for me and information
for others I have decided to start a blog detailing my experiences, projects, and thoughts.

Coming soon will be a post on my thoughts on the [TDWI Data Science Bootcamp](https://events.tdwi.org/events/san-diego-2016/information/data-science-bootcamp.aspx), writing an MCMC in R,
and a few posts on some analysis that I've done on crime and police shooting data.

*Update October 8, 2017:*
*Ok that didn't work out so well. It turns out that searching for jobs and moving
across the country is quite a lot of work. However, I'm back now, nearly a
year after starting this Blog, to try again. Expect some content from me soon...*

*LOL, well here I am again. It turns out that I mainly worked on this website in order
to get a job. Well, I have a good job now and figured I should get back at it. Hopefully
there will be more posts from me soon...*
